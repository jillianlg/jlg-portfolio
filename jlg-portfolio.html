<span class="intro">Welcome to Jillian Gibson's Portfolio Page</span>

<div class="intro-history"><img src="img/jgibson.jpg" class="centered-image">Before jumping into code school, I looked into heading down the Scrum Master or Project Manager route. I am still very much interested in either of those roles as well as Jr Developer. My event operation management background had me leading cross-functional teams in a very similar way to the Agile methodology. <br> While at Opus Agency, I was managing events as well as working with our IT team on a multi-faceted event App, where I contributed to the UX design and back end development. I also helped facilitate communication of complex technical information to our group of non-technical beta testers. Part of my role was to bridge the gap between the users and the developers. Working on the Opus Event App is what sparked my interest in programming! <br> When COVID-19 hit the opportunity arose to pivot my career. Like many, I was laid-off due to lack of work in the event industry. With the event industry at a standstill, I decided to jump and see how adding a foundation of coding to my skill set could lead my career! </div>

Resort Website incorporates link html pages and the use of color, text-align, font-style, font-weight, font-family, font-size, and line-height in a css style sheet. It is missing the gh-pages link and the multiple branches however as we ran out of time to incorporate these.
