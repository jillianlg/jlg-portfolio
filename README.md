#### By _**Jillian Gibson**_

## Description

_This HTML demonstrates the fundamental understanding of the code organization, HTML tags (p, h, ul, ol em, strong, a, img, div and span), Bootstrap classes, and a custom stylesheet (typography styles, cascading, the box model, and floats)._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Select index.html to launch in browser or view via [ghpages](https://github.com/jillianlg/jlg-portfolio/pull/new/gh-pages-2)_


## Known Bugs

_I discoved that you have to be on the HTML tab in VS Code when setting up the gh-pages branch. I was on the README.md tab when I added the branch and accidently created a gh-pages for my README doc. I did not have time to explore how to delete my active gh-pages. Instead I created a second branch called gh-pages-2 however in Git Hub the eviroment is still deploying to my README doc. Not sure how to fix that._
